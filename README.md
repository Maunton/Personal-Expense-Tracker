<h1>{Personal  Expense  Tracker}</h1>

<h2>{Description:}</h2>
The Personal Expense Tracker is a practical and user-friendly Python-based project 
designed to help individuals manage their monthly budgets effectively. This tracker offers an 
interactive menu system that guides users through tasks like adding expenses, setting budgets, and 
viewing their financial details.
<br>
Users can log daily expenses with details like the date, category (e.g., Gas, Food), amount 
spent, and a brief description. Each expense is stored for easy retrieval and management.
<br>
The program enables users to set a monthly budget and track spending against it. If 
expenses exceed the budget, a warning is displayed. Otherwise, users see the remaining balance, 
helping them maintain financial discipline.
